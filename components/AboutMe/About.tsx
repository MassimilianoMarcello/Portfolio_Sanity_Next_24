        Hi, my name is MassDev (Massimiliano), and Iâ€™m a full stack web
        developer. After completing Full Stack Web Development training at Vdab,
        I have continued to develop strong skills in JavaScript, React, Node.js,
        and SQL. Outside of coding, I draw inspiration from my love of music and
        design, always looking for creative ways to bring those passions into my
        projects. I'm eager to find opportunities where I can apply these skills
        and collaborate with forward-thinking web development teams.
