    Hi, I'm Massimiliano — full stack developer based in Brussels, currently the only developer at a pre-seed startup building on Google Cloud Platform with Kubernetes and Terraform.
My path here wasn't linear — communications, radio journalism, restaurant kitchens, social work. What connects all of it is learning complex systems quickly and making them work for real people. I bring that same approach to code: structure, clarity, and attention to who actually uses the product.
Right now I'm expanding into Elixir and Phoenix, with a long-term focus on distributed systems and real-time applications.
